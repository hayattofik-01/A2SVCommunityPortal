## Problem

The A2SV community program has experienced significant growth in popularity, leading to challenges with its current management system. The use of Google Sheets and Telegram channels for managing new joiners and the application process has proven inefficient and difficult to scale. Key problems include:

1. Lack of clear instructions for new joiners
2. Manual work for heads of community
3. Performance issues under heavy load

## Solution

The A2SV Community Portal Mobile App offers a solution by providing a centralized platform that addresses the challenges faced by community members and heads of the community. The key features of the app include:

1. Learning Resource: The app provides learning materials to help new users, especially those unfamiliar with programming, get acquainted with the basics of programming.
2. Road Map: Users are guided through a clear step-by-step process to join the A2SV community education division system. Their progress is tracked, and they are prompted to complete the next required steps while monitoring their progress.
3. Application Management: The app manages new joiners by adding them to a waitlist and assigning them to a group when one becomes available.
4. Contest Creation and Result Tracking: Heads of the community education division can create weekly contests within the app and have access to detailed analysis and tracking of past contests.
5. Announcement System: The app serves as a communication channel between the head of community education and community members, allowing the head of education to create and distribute announcements.

## Plan

The A2SV Community Portal Mobile App is an essential tool in improving the efficiency of the A2SV community program. While the current focus of the project is on onboarding new members to the Community division, there are plans to expand the app in the future to encompass all activities related to community education.
